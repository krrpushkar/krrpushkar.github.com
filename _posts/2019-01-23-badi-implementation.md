Before Implementing any standard BADI, let's see <a id="here">`how to find one first?`</a>

1. Execute SE24. Provide the object type as `CL_EXITHANDLER`. Click on display. 
2. Double click on `GET_INSTANCE` method. 
3. Place the break-point on first call method. 
4. Now we execute our required transaction (which transaction BADIs we want) in a separate session.
5. In the menubar click on debugger -> switch to classic debugger. Provide the field name as EXIT_NAME. Press Enter and Identify the BADI. Continuously click on F8 button. Identify the all the BADIs & maintain in Excel sheet. 

After that delete the break point. Now open the each & every BADI in ‘SE18’. Click on display. Click on interface tab. Double click on each & every method. Identify the input, output parameters. In the menu bar click on goto -> documentation -> to component. Read the documentation if it satisfies our requirement then we implement this method through SE19.

Confused? - Hence in the real time we always identify the BADIs with the help of functional people &#128512;.
