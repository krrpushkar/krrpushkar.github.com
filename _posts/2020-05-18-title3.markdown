description: A brief explanation on how to use Eclipse ADT
---
Eclipse provides a great development experience with the Eclipse client which is easy to  <a href="#">install</a>, use and understand. And it works on major development platforms such as Windows, Mac and Linux, hence we can develop anywhere.

<br/> So Let's explore this new world of ABAP Development through Eclipse.

<br/>Lets first understand the ABAP perspective in Eclipse.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="#">
</div>
<br> In the above image we can see that there are 3 three major section in ABAP perspective.
<br><em><strong style="color: red;">1. Project Explorer View : </strong></em>It will show all the list of ABAP Projects. Also you can add new projects here.
<br>

<em><strong style="color: red;">2. Source Code Editor : </strong></em> Here you'll write the ABAP code :P and also brings up SAP GUI screen.  
<br>
<em><strong style="color: red;">3. Utility Window : </strong></em>We use Utility window frequently for problem log, 
book marker, search option, templates, ABAP unit runner, Debugger option etc.

<br> Now lets understand the navigation in Eclipse using the icons on Toolbar.
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="#">
</div>



{% highlight abap %}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	string myString;

	cout << "input a string: ";
	getline(cin, myString);
	int length = myString.length();
	
	char charArray = new char * [length];

	charArray = myString;
	for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
		cout << charArray[i] << " ";
	}
	
	return 0;
}


{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
DATA : t_itab TYPE TABLE OF VBAP,
       wa_itab TYPE VBAP.
