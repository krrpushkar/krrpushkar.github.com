`Batch Data Communication(BDC)` is a technique to transfer flat files(.txt, excel files) from legacy systems(NON-SAP) to SAP systems or to transfer between SAP systems. Generally flat files contain large volume of data and it enters SAP system through screens(e.g. MM01, VA01, Vf01 etc.)

There are two ways to transfer legacy data to SAP system using BDC:
1. Call Transaction Method - process one transaction at a time.
2. Session Method or Direct Input Method - process more than one transaction.

In this blog I'll discuss Call Transaction Method, create a program to use Call Transaction Method and in the following blogs I'll discuss the remaining two. So lets begin with the Call Transaction Method.

## <code class="highlighter-rouge"><a id="call">Call Transaction Method</a></code>
Lets begin with definition then &#128512; It is a process to transfer flat files into SAP system by `calling a transaction through a series of sequence of steps`.
And some of the properties of this method are:
1. It is a synchronous process i.e it will process the data in the file one by one and the system performs a database commit immediately before and after the `CALL TRANSACTION `statement.
2. It is suitable for files containing less amount of data.
3. Hence it is fast.
4. It will immediatly update the database. And database updation can be either synchronous or asynchronous process.
5. Here we have to manually handle the errors generated while transferring the files.

## <code class="highlighter-rouge"><a id="requirement">Create BDC program with CALL TRANSACTION Method</a></code>
**Requiremet :** Develop conversion program to upload(create) customer master data from flat file(.csv) to SAP Syatem by using BDC Call Transaction Method through XD01 T-code.

Steps to develop the BDC program are:
1. First of all you have to analyze the T-code.
2. Then prepare the flat file.
3. Upload the data from flat file to internal table/BDC program.
4. For each record, fill the screen value using BDC structure `BDCDATA` which has the following components - PROGRAM(BDC module pool), DYNPRO(BDC screen number), DYNBEGIN(BDC start screen), FNAM(Field name), FVAL(BDC Field value). The basic purpose of using `BDCDATA` structure is to Capture the Screen Handling (SHBD) Data into a BDC internal table.

I'd recommend you before starting to create BDC program, go to XD01 and try to create customer there first, in that way you'll get familier with the screen and know which what mandatory data are required to create a customer. Before developing the conversion program you have to do the recording in `SHDB` T-code.

## <code class="highlighter-rouge"><a id="recording">Recording Using SHDB</a></code>
Recording is the process in which we record the steps by means of codes. So after doing recording a file will be generated. We use this file or I should say codes in our program. Then the question arises that why we need to do the recording and get the file? The answer is that BDC is used when we have to upload a large no of data in sap like 1000â€™s or more, and creating these many entries one by one manually is not possible. So in BDC what we do is we create one entry manually and record the process. This recording is used in the program in a loop to make rest of the entries. Just the values will be different each time, check 'POPULATE_BDC' method in example program that I have created in this blog.
1. Execute `SHDB` T-code and click on New Recording.

2. Provide recording name and Transaction code and press Enter.

3. Provide customer number, account group, Enter.

4. Then provide the name , search term, street, country and save.

 You'll see below screen.

Go back and select your recording that you just created and click on 'Program' and provide the program name and enter. 
![createbdc](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3frKeNKPa-OVvK03q52xOFxUAFT8x7lVsMxvvNHIrhQgyXdRQP_Ai7w8lJXpIo0JTfgn0UHBcOdMa2eujRJF65xH3KCbwOfok2sNWNlxEhOdxHYgf4iojRDQspBUUgAykez_L3o9PZ79eM9THnvKxzL=w1288-h388-no?authuser=0)
Provide Title and Press enter and save in package or local file. It is one way of creating BDC program and other one is ABAPers friend 'SE38' &#128522; If you choose 1st option the code will be alreday written in subroutines and you have to just write code for uploading your file there and you are done and also write code to handle the error.

`NOTE :` All subroutines codes are accessible in **INCLUDE BDCRECX1_S.** Either you copy the code the code from here in your report program or use the same report in which you have the include.

But I like to write code with OOPS approach, hence I'll use the same code but in terms of Class and Methods &#128522;

## <code class="highlighter-rouge"> Develope Conversion Program</code>
1. Create a report program and design the screen as per below code in separate Include program 'ZDEMO_BDC_UI'.
![screen](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dI9ZJIVBmOUYZ78IU6hwcqJaf1F7s0K2SKeVr6nvdfBa6zG39gEsQBhlgikl0yT-n3xYhK0iRABCBJtopFeAO0eAypJ6yD0EcWljBHN8Ax3E4pHtVP8E_-tNSK5Cloa9mkxiaH312dO5P01L1qbB_L=w1026-h298-no?authuser=0)
2. Now its turn to define our local class and in that define the data types as well as method definition in separate Include program 'ZDEMO_BDC_CD'.
![definition](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dYyJngl7yZcaFzn_b8kPQ-2K3XJQOKzV4DBK8QNq-vwNHNfNgrtQOrP89N7-uBeFiSFlwDExBexVutynAEKBcumXO02kuhzOo7ZkyzvpCnhW41u-AYISLWTlNd0mvNsyZyu4gRNVAHfOooIHbkcshF=w763-h788-no?authuser=0)
3. Finally implement each method of local class in separate Include program 'ZDEMO_BDC_CI'. Below is the main screen of the report.

**Method F4 Help :** get F4 help for file location on your system.
![f4help](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cJFV6A708WQ33kO0qixH_Vb-AzOuxiC2l2lKpeQ2_CLX_JvaB50mAmzN4YIEdz4_80LCRFoeIMa6xRswYTFDuYiY5PcgXrTOaIAoOntqsrN_L7BKcPxUEAF9pa9E5uABPmqbKK-mTnLWJMiN0GSnaI=w1026-h422-no?authuser=0)
**Method Upload File :** To upload the flat file in the sap system from the legacy system.
![upoadfile](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dT6nmL5WV6yDZpPdlzoHqbq3zU7ailUBs1Stt19Sx5B0AAi926B1jpaD7EFJaprmpB2KtwYqqBX4AEsW4azvbUlLK3sOyt7lOKggC0suIiIT8nAlo83XfmZuWqzHaMcsta088GHVAhgjgu6I4_DWck=w1034-h568-no?authuser=0)

<ol><strong>File to upload</strong>: Prepare an excel sheet like this and while uploading just remove the 1st row <strong>and check that the data you are uploading is not already present in the SAP system.</strong> 
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cZuO4jF01kva2-aUhdHYj5T1ZXKWG3TS6eJBV4LktN73yGfGwDb29EnxdR7JxTVvUa6JlZgzhcNivnxO0y1XOP4u77t2tE3laMuhORYxyl_xyfrAViP-4b9qlf2Rc7XBlo0T4edgj74NTU0BNkr90O=w570-h212-no?authuser=0">

<strong>Method Error file :</strong> This is used to get file location to download the error file, if any error occurs. In Call Transaction Method you have to manually handle the error logs.

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3ckoYssM_roLEDpl8BTVxIgn8V2bPkKcbSWGEHSP4H7TAUhkFd-IVzcORw_8HgVWdwAeFz3aXbcdeQXTC2Mjpj2i96izjn7EmHTUDj58gKWBPXpZmHybDzc4m9FYAa2RuR3taoRoV1HrTW2TIS2cZfT=w1040-h424-no?authuser=0">

<strong>Method Populate BDC :</strong> I have manually written code to populate BDC structure for all the screen. But you can check the <strong>Include BDCRECX1_S</strong> and inside this include check the subroutine <strong>BDC_DYNPRO</strong> and <strong>BDC_FIELD.</strong> Below code is copied from there only, and you thought that I remembered all these lines of code &#128512;

As you can see its pretty easy to create conversion program once you get your hands on experience you will become more comfortable.
