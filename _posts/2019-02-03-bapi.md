BAPIs stands for Buisness Application Programming Interface(s). BAPI's are nothing but Remote Enabled Function Module(aka RFCs) and are defined in Buisness Object repository(BOR).

<code class="highlighter-rouge"><strong>BOR :</strong></code> It is a repository of Buisness Objects. Execute T-code `SWO1` and you can find the Buisness Object Repository. BOR takes care about version change management, whenever version is changed, if any change is required in BAPI it's taken care by the BOR.

<code class="highlighter-rouge"><strong>Buisness Object :</strong></code> It is a representation of any business entity in SAP system. For example purchase order, sales order, material etc. A buisness object include both the data of the entity and the function it performs. You can relate Buisness Object to classes. Hence you can understand Buisness Object as an Object Oriented approach to model buisness entities and processes. Data of the entity is stored in form of attributes and function of entity as methods.

Go to T-code `SWO1` and provide Object Type as `'BUS2012'`, buisness object name for purchase order and click on display. You'll find a list of attributes and methods for this buisness object. 
![bor](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3e48LZp8GgKtPKUcopjWJHiFq7U5oVHckrKRM9wT0Kf_Hc75ulnUC1wcedKCdkJpV3B3V08g0Zyx0BPUzGGr_50pcQUEDepxJCO_vcpgPprR4nnUDMH_JDA2FVJ86TXik4m_t2-tFJdp2ppV0GGY_gO=w974-h788-no?authuser=0)
Double click on any method and go to 'ABAP' tab and there you can find the BAPI name.
![methodgetitems](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fYcWXH1REa1BmQss9AEL1uASRBlwJfI5gIO1juj4BYDhaBiHolVbEX5HXlzo4kkYiLGwHvNoBJ6LOD7HDHZDGY2eYFZbji3y46WFpBGWfhcM-jZ24OeI2HGQZ1qzbp1WhePTDxDIoOUMXk7Mj972Zw=w790-h788-no?authuser=0)
So now you have got some ideas regarding Buisness objects, what are they and what they represents. Also you might be little bit comfortable with BAPI as they are nothing but Function Module which are Remote Enabled and stored in BOR. And I know you must be thinking if BAPI is also a RFC then why we need to add this BAPI in BOR as function of both RFC and BAPI is same after all i.e to transfer data between SAP and NON-SAP system. But the main difference is that It is not possible to connect SAP to Non-SAP systems to retrieve data using RFC alone. RFC can access the SAP from outside only through BAPI. BAPI acts as an Interface to NON-SAP systems like VB, JAVA via BOR. NON-SAP applications can access BOR.Â 

## <code class="highlighter-rouge">What is the Use of BAPI?</code>
1. BAPIs are used to connected with R/3 to new SAP components BI/BW, APO, CRM, SCM etc.
2. BAPIs are used to connect with R/3 to internet by using IACS (Internet Application Components).
3. BAPIs are used to connect with distributed system with the help of ALE.
4. BAPIs are used to connect with VB as a front end to R/3 system.
5. BAPIs are used to connect with SAP to legacy system.
6. BAPIs are used to connect with SAP to non-sap system.

First lets find the standard BAPIs for any given transaction, in real time functional consultants will let you know which BAPI to use. After that I'll explain how to create custom BAPI.

To find standard BAPI you can go to T-code `'BAPI'`, YES! BAPI is the T-code for BAPI explorer, there you can search with the buisness object name and once you expand the buisness object you'll see all the method and when you double click on the method name, in the detail tab you'll find the BAPI name and in SE37 you can check the parameters of the BAPI.
![bapiexplore](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3e0tfZRgbyXu3laA4UPVlFwfAom50XoyeYsD9HU-TMQA6b796PpeKHHLO1w9Nvb6bFsUV0XEcv6C9lUxdOkX2LJRDZuJh_v99yysYsj_1Wu-KCfdod2rRYZ-platpsVbNT5JF7XnzVkFbImM2nr15YK=w728-h788-no?authuser=0)
Another method to find the BAPI is to execute the T-code and get the package name of the T-code, if you don't know then <a href="/function-module-exit#exactline">Click here.</a> 
Once you get the package name, go to se80, select package and provide your package name and press enter. Inside Buisness Engineering folder on expanding Buisness object types you will find all the object types.
![se80bo](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3efYybBLYQzL481F0stCR5cvHnUGKV9yj0JOCL8wVdKfoxnDCCAm-9r5kx3GGxjpUBPpPQdoo0kjm6IjkJN0lVTO19eHOARblAAzW5eiJdw4ht1oTK8Zk8vObFnNk5ZTf6KpIiT1ymy79R_NmD6PA54=w1021-h788-no?authuser=0)
And finally you can in T-code SWO1 you can check all the BAPIs related to this buisness object.

Now lets create a custom BAPI and then using a simple use case I'll explain how to use it.

## <code class="highlighter-rouge">How To Create Custom BAPI?</code>
**Use Case :** Lets develop a custom BAPI to display the purchasing document number(EBELN), document date(BEDAT) and vendor number(LIFNR) based on the given purchasing document number.
Basic rules you need to keep in mind before creating a custom BAPI,
1. Every name start wit BAPI or ZBAPI.
2. Every parameter must be pass by value, since BAPI is nothing but RFCs.
3. BAPI must have return parameter of type BAPIRET2.

There are few basic steps to create a BAPI,
<br><code class="highlighter-rouge">Step 1: </code><strong>Create a BAPI structrure.</strong>
<br>Go to SE11 and create a structure 'ZBAPI_STR' with component type EBELN, BEDAT, LIFNR.
![bapistructure](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cBVtxVMqAwdq_WUS11FPa--OBqqm9N-uUx8wqcFDgJW2AUqjEUoYtBwJACgIx9nNSq09mZDYBoSDy2NpWsN58fn7-yzDDgEw8Z243HGjfm061kgXrsHedGD7GNJJzuPzYV0IraSREqG17RFPE9fjPe=w1440-h530-no?authuser=0)
<br><code class="highlighter-rouge">Step 2: </code><strong>Create and Release a RFC function module.</strong>
<br>Go to SE80 choose Function group from the drop down and create 'ZBAPI_FG' function group and activate it.
Then Go to SE37 and create a fuction module 'Z_BAPI_FM' with importing paramater as EBELN and exporting parameter of type 'ZBAPI_STR' structure and `'RETURN'` parameter. Select the `pass by value` checkbox for each importing and exporting parameter. In source code write a select query to fetch data from 'EKKO' table and in the attribute tab select `Remote-Enabled Module`. Save and activate it.
![fm](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3duK6OsFcQOBT7MPjeBvUuGZ-6Gc87ARn3lZ0cH42fasSXi3zj9VZeOG8O_u3c9GjdL453CNppl2tKUc6Icib7p0Mz8Tndlcx626cJNGrYzM_BPRHwTflCmtobFPW0Xaj-CSDkjdxNNr-s3OW8ibrp-=w945-h788-no?authuser=0)
Now go to attributes tab in the Function module and from the menu bar choose Function Module->Release->Release.
![releasefm](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3c7g06KZd4Zbk_Z2bB9V5Z6wlsNCZZ2bacvXfvynm33A3ftyottHQ-o5uVHBoeKsqhkSjOmvd160MSxwsAEotUvzNzUs-rFmSJeokNHl3OttyZTCKGZ358DpxQIn2RNUiW3mOeyXW6BgGcepJJr98Rj=w1029-h788-no?authuser=0)
<br><code class="highlighter-rouge">Step 3: </code><strong>Create buisness object in SWO1.</strong>
<li>Execute Tcode 'SWO1' and provide 'ZBAPI_DEMO' as object name and click create.

<br><code class="highlighter-rouge">Step 4: </code><strong>Release and generate the Buisness Object and generate.</strong>

<br>After creating the buisness object you have to add it to the BOR, hence you need to release it first and then generate it.
<li>Go to Edit->Change Release Statue->Object Type->To modeled.
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fWkZxDGX3wfaJdBoW0POzNoscj0515ki2HmPTPUujQi8tTbAjmzVI4t3buFO36gaG4bxA4DgPfiFTp_YY-WQfWUs7uQaVTycuTAxecQulsPzrt23njC2lP6IcYktstQ9dGc8qCZXLNixBUSvpfBtRu=w1266-h732-no?authuser=0">

After that change status to 'To Implemented', 'To Release' subsequently.
<li>Once you change status to 'To Release' then click on 'GENERATE' icon. And your BAPI will be generated.

<br><code class="highlighter-rouge">Step 5: </code><strong>Check if BAPI is present in BOR.</strong>
<br>Now to check if BAPI is added in the BOR or not execute T-code 'BAPI' go to Alphabetical tab and check your BAPI name, double clik on it and you will see the details.

<code class="highlighter-rouge"><strong>Note:</strong></code><br> 
1. In real time you will not create BAPI, you will use the existing BAPI.<br>
2. If you are not able see your BAPI in BAPI Explore, then the problem might be that your BAPI did not get released due to some problem hence Go to 'Goto' option in menu bar select BAPIs to display and select radio button 'All'.

<br>Now its all set to use in your report program. Just call the BAPI using function module name.<br>

<h2> <code class="highlighter-rouge">How To Use BAPI In ABAP Report?</code></h2>
I'll use BAPI 'Z_BAPI_FM' in my report program to display the purchasing document number(EBELN), document date(BEDAT) and vendor number(LIFNR) based on the given purchasing document number.
1. Create a report program.
2. Call BAPI in report.

<h2> <code class="highlighter-rouge">BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT VS COMMIT WORK</code></h2>
When you make changes in SAP databases by calling a BAPI from outside SAP, you need to commit the database either by using statement <code class="highlighter-rouge">'COMMIT WORK'</code> or calling another BAPI <code class="highlighter-rouge">'BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT'</code>.
<br>When you go to 'BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT' in SE37 you can see quickly what is different from COMMIT WORK. It calls BUFFER_REFRESH_ALL function module right after COMMIT WORK.
So BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT additionally refreshes a "BAPI buffer".
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cRN-Ie7Mt0Y7Na7gAN6azxLfgwlwIK6x47nN96aWbZzZqcF1GG5dTnGVHzrfark0zB0C3h6tUdsADMh2J6oTQX2XT7yLAUudHHMyO3wqc-C4LR1IjQGnUhphzwms7T7Nsrvt0UhcYUxhew_lq8RpDS=w919-h788-no?authuser=0">
Now the question comes in mind is : <code class="highlighter-rouge">what BAPI buffer is for?</code>

<br>Assuming your program calls BAPIs consecutively and use a COMMIT WORK or BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT only at the end so that to commit all BAPI updates once (better performance).
<br>As you know, BAPIs need to check errors like data missing in database. For example, the second BAPI may have to check the existence of data written by the previously called BAPI. The data doesn't exist in database yet, but as it knows it will be written later at COMMIT WORK time, it uses a buffer (memory) to store this information, so that no error is raised.
<br>Let's suppose the update during the COMMIT WORK fails (for any reason), the data is not written to database. If you have not refreshed the buffer using BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT, the next BAPI calls will consider that some data will exist later, that is wrong. Hence I'd recommend to use BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT while making changes in SAP databases.
