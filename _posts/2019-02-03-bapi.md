BAPIs stands for Buisness Application Programming Interface(s). BAPI's are nothing but Remote Enabled Function Module(aka RFCs) and are defined in Buisness Object repository(BOR).

<code class="highlighter-rouge"><strong>BOR :</strong></code> It is a repository of Buisness Objects. Execute T-code `SWO1` and you can find the Buisness Object Repository. BOR takes care about version change management, whenever version is changed, if any change is required in BAPI it's taken care by the BOR.

<code class="highlighter-rouge"><strong>Buisness Object :</strong></code> It is a representation of any business entity in SAP system. For example purchase order, sales order, material etc. A buisness object include both the data of the entity and the function it performs. You can relate Buisness Object to classes. Hence you can understand Buisness Object as an Object Oriented approach to model buisness entities and processes. Data of the entity is stored in form of attributes and function of entity as methods.

Go to T-code `SWO1` and provide Object Type as `'BPR_PURORD'`, buisness object name for purchase order and click on display. You'll find a list of attributes and methods for this buisness object. Double click on any method and go to 'ABAP' tab and there you can find the BAPI name.

So now you have got some ideas regarding Buisness objects, what are they and what they represents. Also you might be little bit comfortable with BAPI as they are nothing but Function Module which are Remote Enabled and stored in BOR.

## <code class="highlighter-rouge">What is the Use of BAPI?</code>
1. BAPIs are used to connected with R/3 to new SAP components BI/BW, APO, CRM, SCM etc.
2. BAPIs are used to connect with R/3 to internet by using IACS (Internet Application Components).
3. BAPIs are used to connect with distributed system with the help of ALE.
4. BAPIs are used to connect with VB as a front end to R/3 system.
5. BAPIs are used to connect with SAP to legacy system.
6. BAPIs are used to connect with SAP to non-sap system.

First lets find the standard BAPIs for any given transaction, in real time functional consultants will let you know which BAPI to use. After that I'll explain how to create custom BAPI.
