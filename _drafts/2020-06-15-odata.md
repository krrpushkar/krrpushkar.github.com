Before explaining What is Odata? Let's discuss Why Odata? Say for example, your client want to perform sales order creation through their own NON-SAP application and you know exchanging data  between SAP and NON-SAP would be difficult as their programming languages are completely different. But SAP has <a href="/bapi">`BAPI( Buisness Application Programming Interface )`</a> which can be used used for interfacing third-party system with SAP. Every BAPI is basically a `RFC( Remote Enabled Funtion Module )`, so in order to exchange data through third-party RFC's are called or invoked. RFC's act as a window from where NON-SAP applications can get the data.

As you know NON-SAP application would have been developed in different programming languages like .NET, JAVA etc So for each NON-SAP application you would require different solution to get the data. .NET application is using RFC to get data from SAP, JAVA applcations uses Jco connection to BAPI to get data from SAP. You'll get a clear picture after looking at below picture.

This is a `point-to-point solution` i.e. for each different NON-SAP application you are designing a different solution. Now a days the SAP data is now stored in multiple storage sources, data could be in `SAP BW system`, or in `HANA database`, also client might be using `SRM`, `CRM` or other system to store data hence the system becomes complex and there could be maintenance issues, upgrade issues etc. Also this led to the duplicacy of work, effort,time and money.

So there was a need of better solution, in which all NON-SAP applications uses same solution to get the data from SAP. So basically we need to look for commonalities between each of these systems and the answer is `HTTP protocol` since all the users of these applications works over internet( and Internet works on HTTP protocol ). Hence if we develop a techonolgy of data communication over the HTTP protocol then all the systems can easily consume the data in uniform way.

Here comes the `Open Data Protocol( Odata )` as a solution to above problem. **Odata is an open interface which can be consumed by any application, program, software or device of the NON-SAP world that can connect with SAP using the HTTP(S) protocol**.

## Advantages of Odata 
1. The Odata interface is implemented using `XML` or `JSON` and both these formats are common, plain text protocols for transmission of data over the web.
2. Odata message is self-describing, hence for NON-SAP developers, they don't need to have SAP development knowledge. As in previous cases NON-SAP developers needed to know how SAP works i.e the structures of the data passed from the SAP so that they can consume it in their application.
3. With Odata organizations can develop services with the high levels of data integration and cross platform interoperability.

## Odata and REST
Odata is `REST` inspired technology for reading, writing, and modifying information on the web. **REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer**. REST is an architectural style that uses simple and lighweight mechanism for inter machine communication. For example in our case if NON-SAP system wants to access some data from SAP system, it has to send a request to the SAP server to access the resources. REST defines how these resources can be accessed?

Any communication between client( NON-SAP system, which consumes the Odata service ) and server( SAP system, which provides the Odata service ) are using **URI**( Unified Resource Identifier ) over HTTP protocol. The URI is the representation of the resources( like POHeader, Customer, Vendor etc.). Don't worry about these resource names when you'll create an Odata it will become more clear so hang in there. And to read, write or modify the Odata RESTful methods are used : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. These are also known as normal HTTP verbs.
1. `POST`   : is used to add new resource into the system.
2. `GET`    : is used to get the representation of an existing resource.
3. `PUT`    : is used to modify the existing resource.
4. `DELETE` : is used to delete the resource from the system.

I know you are still confused and not able to fully understand Odata, like I was when I started my Odata journey and after going through the definitions I didn't completely understood it. So let me explain this whole scenario from a beginners perspective. Suppose You have created one application, for the sake of simplicity lets say using Web Dynpro but it can be in developed in some other language, any way that doesn't matter with Odata &#128522;. Okay! So you have a screen where you are taking Purchasing Document Number( EBELN ) as an input and there is a button 'Display'. It can be as simple as below screenshot.

![simple_application](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cSYhxg9rz39OjM8gbEli31Hpid7BoNmBXWT_KjiD3iJKXkhOtQ_i3-xNCt7UsIFnuuopI1AxgjzP8JWqoMmAk7KG2kNLJO9dmVh8egMvKl-eoysuoy2GkMOaR9cD1af3wEiQfosWM1_lhFyzQGHQ7Y=w478-h176-no?authuser=0)

When a user click on the button the application calls one method and inside that method 'GET' method is called using the Odata URI.
```
DATA(l_url) = 'https://<your_server_name>:<port_number>
              /sap/opu/odata/SAP/ZDEMO_ODATA_SRV?POHeaderSet'

Here '/sap/opu/odata/SAP/ZDEMO_ODATA_SRV?POHeaderSet' is request URL,
     '/sap/opu/odata/SAP/ZDEMO_ODATA_SRV' is request URI,
     'POHeaderSet' is the Resource name. 
```
Let me attach the screenshot then it will become more clear.
![odata](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3diQuFLpsvbLMgf_o6q2wkAJn6tE48xD2-w5viB3R6PJFxzwtHWPTHu57oS2trlwRKRqAf9HecKUs8OX0XaflRs_q6CnK7nN6UYG6XpW07RmjwHwHOnVwzrJNCbe9kMbyFLgHbGHi68ZNkwSBWqbXXS=w1370-h276-no?authuser=0)
Now you will get the data in `JSON` format and according to your application programmming language you can read the JSON file and use it in the application. But as an ABAPer your main job would be to create Odata service.
I hope now, you have got some idea how it works? If still confused then wait for next blog there I will create an Odata service then you will understand the URIs and HTTP methods.

## SAP NetWeaver Gateway
Before going to create your first Odata service lets take a quick look at `SAP NetWeaver Gateway`.
SAP NetWeaver Gateway sits in the SAP application layer. It is the window for NON-SAP world to transfer data to/from SAP. Outer world can send HTTP message and SAP would provide them with Odata. SAP NetWeaver Gateway is a technology that seamlessly connects devices, platforms and environments to SAP Enterprise data using the Odata services. It offers connectivity to SAP Buisness data using any programming language and without the need of strong SAP development knowledge.

In next blog I will show how to create an Odata service.
