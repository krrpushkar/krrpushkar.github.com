In the <a href="/odata">last blog</a> I post about the concepts of Odata, REST and HTTP, I hope you have gone through that before coming to this post and have a fair idea of Why Odata is required? What is Odata and REST? So lets go ahead and generate the Odata service and consume it in your SAPUI5 application or any other applications.

Below are the basic steps to create an Odata service.
1. <a href="/create-odata#step1">Define Data Model : </a>The abstract data model that is used to describe the data exposed by an OData service. An OData Metadata Document is a representation of a service's data model exposed for client consumption.The central concepts in the EDM are entities, relationships, entity sets, actions, and functions.
2. <a href="/create-odata#step2">Implement the Generated Service.</a>
3. <a href="/create-odata#step3">Add the generated service to service catalog i.e. Register the service to Gateway Hub.</a>
